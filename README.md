# Arduino Client for MQTT
This library provides a client for doing simple publish/subscribe messaging with a server that supports MQTT

For more information about MQTT, visit [mqtt.org](http://mqtt.org/).
## Download
The latest version of the library can be downloaded from [GitHub](https://github.com/knolleary/pubsubclient/releases/tag/v2.7)
## Documentation
The library comes with a number of example sketches. See File > Examples > PubSubClient within the Arduino application.
Full [API Documentation](https://pubsubclient.knolleary.net/api.html).
## Compatible Hardware
The library uses the Arduino Ethernet Client api for interacting with the underlying network hardware. This means it Just Works with a growing number of boards and shields, including:

- Arduino Ethernet
- Arduino Ethernet Shield
- Arduino YUN – use the included YunClient in place of EthernetClient, and be sure to do a Bridge.begin() first
- Arduino WiFi Shield - if you want to send packets greater than 90 bytes with this shield, enable the [MQTT_MAX_TRANSFER_SIZE]  (https://pubsubclient.knolleary.net/api.html#configoptions) option in   PubSubClient.h.
- Sparkfun WiFly Shield – when used with [this](https://github.com/dpslwk/WiFly) library
- Intel Galileo/Edison
- ESP8266
- ESP32
The library cannot currently be used with hardware based on the ENC28J60 chip – such as the Nanode or the Nuelectronics Ethernet Shield. For those, there is an alternative library available.

# Wire Library
  The Wire library allows you to communicate with I2C devices, often also called "2 wire" or "TWI" (Two Wire Interface),can download  from [Wire.h](https://github.com/PaulStoffregen/Wire)
## Basic Usage
- Wire.begin()
  Begin using Wire in master mode, where you will initiate and control data transfers. This is the most common use when interfacing with   most I2C peripheral chips.

- Wire.begin(address)
  Begin using Wire in slave mode, where you will respond at "address" when other I2C masters chips initiate communication.
  
 ## Transmitting
 - Wire.beginTransmission(address)
   Start a new transmission to a device at "address". Master mode is used.

- Wire.write(data)
  Send data. In master mode, beginTransmission must be called first.

- Wire.endTransmission()
  In master mode, this ends the transmission and causes all buffered data to be sent.
  
## Receiving
- Wire.requestFrom(address, count)
  Read "count" bytes from a device at "address". Master mode is used.

- Wire.available()
  Retuns the number of bytes available by calling receive.

- Wire.read()
  Receive 1 byte.


##  Uploading the code  to ESP32 using Arduino IDE:

- **Before uploading the code you can view the working of this sensor at a given [link](https://github.com/ncdcommunity/Industrial-Wireless-IoT-Temperature-Humidity-Sensor?source=post_page---------------------------).**
- **Download and include the PubSubClient Library and Wire.h Library.**
- **You must assign your API key , SSID (WiFi Name) and Password of the available network.**
- **Compile and upload the  [Temp-ThinSpeak.ino](https://github.com/mjScientech/ThingSpeak-ESP32-and-Long-Range-Wireless-Temp-and-Humidity-Sensor/blob/master/Thingspeak_Temp.ino) code.**
- **To verify the connectivity of the device and the data sent, open the serial monitor.If no response is seen, try unplugging your ESP32 and then plugging it again. Make sure the baud rate of the Serial monitor is set to the same one specified in your code 115200.**

## Create an IFTTT Applet
- To send data to thingspeak  you can view it at this [link](https://github.com/ncdcommunity/ThingSpeak-ESP32-and-Long-Range-Wireless-Temp-and-Humidity-Sensor).
- IFTTT is a web service that lets you create applets that act in response to another action. You can use the IFTTT Webhooks service to create web requests to trigger an action. The incoming action is an HTTP request to the web server, and the outgoing action is an email message.
- First create  an IFTTT account.
- Create an applet. Select My Applets.
